# talk_2025-01-29_vue-js-nation-conference

## project overview

This project contains the slides for my talk titled `Your Own Vite Plugin? That's as easy as 1 2 3(D)` on 2025-01-29 at the [Vue.js Nation 2025](https://vuejsnation.com/) conference (online).

The presented, repository and documentation language is `English`.

You can find pre deployed slides here, so that you can view them without the need of pulling the code and setting the project up yourself:<br>

## dev

### initial setup

#### VM ID

Development VM ID from Thorsten Seyschab for this project: `014`<br>
(Only interesting to him.)

#### project setup

1. execute a `git pull`
2. open project in VSCode
3. If you work with VSCode via remote software:
   - `{Ctrl}+{Shift}+{P}` -> `>Preferences: Open Settings (UI)` -> search for `keyboard.dispatch` and set it to `keyCode`
   - Restart or reload VSCode.
4. Install recommended extensions/ plugins:
   - Open Extensions menu in VSCode (`{Ctrl}+{Shift}+{X}`)
   - type in the search `@recommended`
   - install and enable the plugins
   - see file `.vscode/extensions.json` for configuring some of the extensions
   - Restart or reload VSCode.
5. In VSCode on the bottom left click your profile image and log in all services (GitHub due to VSCode extensions, ...)<br>
   If the browser to VSCode callback fails (e.g. due to remote working on a VM), wait for the login popup on the
   bottom right to timeout (ca. 5 minutes) and then on the upcoming popup question<br>
   `You have not yet finished authorizing [...] Would you like to try a different way? (local server)` click `Yes`
   and use this alternative login mechanic.
6. Duplicate `.env.example` as `.env` and set the environment variables:
   1. You must set the variable `VITE_ZLIG_DEMO_BASE_URL` with the base URL of the `zlig` demo branch
      [feat/conference-2025-vue-js-nation](https://github.com/toddeTV/zlig/tree/feat/conference-2025-vue-js-nation).
      Therefore, you can pull this branch and use it locally (recommended!), or use the pre-build dev demo URL
      from the `zlig` PR [//TODO] (not recommended!).
7. Install dependencies: `pnpm i`
8. Happy coding <3

### scripts / commands

```shell
# dev run
pnpm run dev[:network]
# you get (with set `:network` it will be open in your network; otherwise only local):
# - public slide show   > http://[localhost/IP]:3030/
# - presenter mode      > http://[localhost/IP]:3030/presenter/

# build
pnpm run build

# export
pnpm run export
```

### lint and prettier

This project uses [antfu/eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config) for eslint most of the files.
The following extend it:

- [antfu/eslint-plugin-format](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-plugin-format) for using external formatters like
  e.g. `prettier` for the file types that eslint cannot handle.
- [azat-io/eslint-plugin-perfectionist](https://github.com/azat-io/eslint-plugin-perfectionist) for
  sorting object keys, imports, etc. - with auto-fix.

Keep in mind that the plugin names are renamed, see
[Plugins Rename](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config?tab=readme-ov-file#plugins-renaming), e.g.:

```diff
-// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/consistent-type-definitions
+// eslint-disable-next-line ts/consistent-type-definitions
type foo = { bar: 2 }
```

### Design

#### used icon collections

This project uses the following icon collections in descending order, try sticking to them and use from top to bottom.
Tipp: Favorite them and use the search over all item collections at once: https://icon-sets.iconify.design/?list=favorite
